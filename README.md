Swift 2 snippets for Xcode

Just a few for the moment, based on those by Matt Thompson at https://github.com/Xcode-Snippets/Objective-C

# Installing The Snippets

## Manually

In Xcode 7, open a workspace and toggle the right sidebar to be visible. On the bottom, there is a panel with four icons in the header. Click on the `{ }` icon to open the Code Snippets Library.

Now copy-paste the code from one of these snippets, highlight the code block you just pasted and drag it to the Code Snippet panel. Make sure to match the suggested platform, language, and completion scope. The completion shortcut corresponds to the filename of the code snippet.

## Using the xcodesnippet gem 
_by @mattt, does the guy ever sleep?_

First, install the gem `gem install xcodesnippet`

Then install the snippet you want with:

```
xcodesnippet install path/to/file
```
